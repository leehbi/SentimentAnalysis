<h1>Natural Language Processing</h1>
<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP) is the technology used to help machines to understand and learn text and language.</p>
<p>With NLP we aim to teach machines to understand what is said and written to make sense of the human language. It is used to apply algorithms to text and speech to extract</p>
<p>Massive subject area - this is an introduction</p>
<h1>Pre-requsitives</h1>
<p>Basic knowledge of python</p>
<h1>Concepts</h1>
<h2>Syntactic Analysis</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Parsing — Involves undertaking grammatical analysis for the provided sentence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lemmatisation — reduces various inflected forms of a word into a single form.  Returns the lemma for the word based on it's intended meaning.  Openly researched.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stemming — Cuts the inflected words to their root form.  Very fast but not very accurate.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word segmentation — divides a large piece of continuous text into distinct units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Morphological segmentation — divides words into individual units.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Part-of-speech tagging — identify the part of speech for every word.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Sentence breaking — Places sentence boundaries on a large piece of text</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Semantic Analysis</h2>
<p>Semantics refers to the meaning of the sentence. A sentence that is syntactically correct does not mean lto be always semantically correct.</p>

<h1>NLTK</h1>
<p>Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) is an open-source package in Python which allows us to run all common NLP tasks.</p>
<p>It provides easy-to-use interfaces and a suite of text processing libraries with steps involved during preprocessing i.e. classification, tokenization, stemming, tagging, parsing, and semantic reasoning.</p>
